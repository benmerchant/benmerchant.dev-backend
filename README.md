# Ben Merchant dot dev - back end

### [Front End Here](https://github.com/benmerchant/benmerchant.dev)

Trying to make something out of this mess. Every commit before this one was my first true attempt to make something with knowledge only of `JavaScript`, not `MEAN`. Also, going to try to track my progress. I heard that you don't need to timestamp everything since that is inherent in `git`. I'll do my best.

* Didn't even have a `.gitignore`. As a result, I pushed `/node_modules` last year. Let's remedy that.
*### Checked Windows Explorer for size of the folder
##### Size: 49.0 MB (51,414,395 bytes)
##### Contains: 10,574 Files, 1,628 Folders*

- [x] `touch .gitignore`
- [x] `vi .gitignore`
- [x] (You can figure out how to insert text and exit I'm sure)
- [x] `rm -rf node_modules`


* Six security alerts:
1. lodash -       low severity
1. just-extend -  low severity
1. mpath -        low severity
1. extend -       low severity
1. deep-extend -  high severity
1. cryptiles -    high severity



* Check out [package.json](https://github.com/benmerchant/benmerchant.dev-backend/blob/1743ef68cefb5a0c632d2759c422f048c66cb7d3/package.json) from `1743ef6` on May 3, 2018.

* Going to attempt `npm install` with carats on all of the current packages. See if they'll still work together. At their respective highest major version. It will also be interesting to see if the security warnings go away.
