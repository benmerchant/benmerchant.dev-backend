# Ben Merchant dot dev - back end

### [Front End Here](https://github.com/benmerchant/benmerchant.dev)

Trying to make something out of this mess. Every commit before this one was my first true attempt to make something with knowledge only of `JavaScript`, not `MEAN`. Also, going to try to track my progress. I heard that you don't need to timestamp everything since that is inherent in `git`. I'll do my best.

* Didn't even have a `.gitignore`. As a result, I pushed `/node_modules` last year. Let's remedy that.
*Checked Windows Explorer for size of the folder
Size: 49.0 MB (51,414,395 bytes)
Contains: 10,574 Files, 1,628 Folders*

- [x] `touch .gitignore`
- [x] `vi .gitignore`
- [x] (You can figure out how to insert text and exit I'm sure)
- [x] `rm -rf node_modules`

* Six security alerts:
1. lodash -       low severity
1. just-extend -  low severity
1. mpath -        low severity
1. extend -       low severity
1. deep-extend -  high severity
1. cryptiles -    high severity


* Check out [package.json](https://github.com/benmerchant/benmerchant.dev-backend/blob/1743ef68cefb5a0c632d2759c422f048c66cb7d3/package.json) from `1743ef6` on May 3, 2018 (the most recent commit).

* Going to attempt `npm install` with carats on all of the current packages. See if they'll still work together. At their respective highest major version. It will also be interesting to see if the security warnings go away. Going to commit first.

- [x] `npm install`
- `package.json` didn't change one bit at all. I figured with the carats at least some of the modules would move up a minor version.
- `package-lock.json` changed a lot. Many sub-dependencies. Maybe we'll delve another day


```
added 806 packages from 1120 contributors and audited 3184 packages in 30.516s
found 26 vulnerabilities (5 low, 18 moderate, 3 high)
  run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details
```
*Just realized this would be better as a Medium article. But who's going to read it anyways.*

- [x] `npm audit`
- [ ] Parse and link audit report later.

##### Here are the highlights:
* `Run  npm install --save-dev nyc@13.3.0  to resolve 12 vulnerabilities`
* `Run  npm install mongoose@5.4.19  to resolve 2 vulnerabilities`
* `Run  npm install --save-dev morgan@1.9.1  to resolve 1 vulnerability`
* `Run  npm install --save-dev nodemon@1.18.10  to resolve 3 vulnerabilities`
* `Run  npm update jws --depth 2  to resolve 3 vulnerabilities`
* `Run  npm update request --depth 2  to resolve 2 vulnerabilities`
* `Run  npm update lodash --depth 2  to resolve 1 vulnerability`
* `Run  npm update handlebars --depth 2  to resolve 1 vulnerability`
* `Run  npm update nise --depth 2  to resolve 1 vulnerability`

- [x] `npm audit fix`

```
+ morgan@1.9.1
+ nodemon@1.18.10
+ mongoose@5.4.19
added 39 packages from 51 contributors, removed 48 packages and updated 47 packages in 30.248s
fixed 14 of 26 vulnerabilities in 3184 scanned packages
  1 package update for 12 vulns involved breaking changes
  (use `npm audit fix --force` to install breaking changes; or refer to `npm audit` for steps to fix these manually)
```

##### Don't want to break it, since it does technically work right now... So:
- [x] `npm audit`

##### Well, since they are all `nyc` and I wasn't planning on worrying about code coverage in this sprint, I'm going to do the force option to see what happens.
- [x] `npm audit fix --force`

`npm WARN using --force I sure hope you know what you are doing.`

*Spoiler Alert: I do not.*

```
> fsevents@1.2.7 install Y:\bmdev-back\node_modules\fsevents
> node install

+ nyc@13.3.0
added 108 packages from 88 contributors, removed 220 packages, updated 67 packages and moved 1 package in 13.293s
fixed 12 of 12 vulnerabilities in 4048 scanned packages
  1 package update for 12 vulns involved breaking changes
  (installed due to `--force` option)
```

### Lets try it out, see what happens
But first, `package.json` did change after the `--force`:
`mongoose`  from 5.0.16 to 5.4.19
`morgan`    from 1.9.0 to 1.9.1
`nodemon`   from 1.17.3 to 1.18.10
`nyc`       from 11.7.1 to 13.3.0

#### New self-question: How do you [Semantically Version](https://semver.org/) software?

- [x] `npm test`

Wait a second. I don't have MongoDB running...
I use a regular CMD for that. So, I can click on GitBash and only one window pop up.

- [x] `mongod` // its nice since it's a PATH variable now.

Let's try that again:

- [x] `npm test`

Too long for here. Relevant snippets:
```(node:11724) DeprecationWarning: current URL string parser is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version. To use the new parser, pass option { useNewUrlParser: true } to MongoClient.connect.
(node:11724) DeprecationWarning: collection.ensureIndex is deprecated. Use createIndexes instead.
(node:11724) DeprecationWarning: collection.remove is deprecated. Use deleteOne, deleteMany, or bulkWrite instead.
(node:11724) DeprecationWarning: collection.findAndModify is deprecated. Use findOneAndUpdate, findOneAndReplace or findOneAndDelete instead.

20 passing (5s)
2 failing

1) Employees
     LOGIN / LOGOUT
       it should not login employee if email not in database:

    Uncaught AssertionError: expected { Object (_events, _eventsCount, ...) } to have status code 200 but got 400


2) Roles
     /POST create new role
       it should not POST a new role without salaried field - Mongoose:

    Uncaught AssertionError: expected { Object (_events, _eventsCount, ...) } to have status code 200 but got 500

```

If I say so myself, those are some well-written tests that just document themselves. And even after forcing NPM to give us new modules, only two tests failed.

Now, the badges on the original repo say
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benmerchant/StartPOS-backend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benmerchant/StartPOS-backend)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/benmerchant/StartPOS-backend/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/benmerchant/StartPOS-backend?branch=master).

So, what has changed?

For one, I was using node -v 8 before. Now, my local machine is
```$ node -v
v10.15.3
```

Let's ignore the `.travis.yml` and `.coveralls.yml` for now. Well, coveralls is empty, so, delete.
```vi .gitignore
```

'[a]'

'.travis.yml'

':wq'

#### One more thing before a break and a switching of gears.
There is a /coverage folder with beautifully illustrated breakdowns of the code coverage in HTML. It didn't generate any just now. I wonder why. Either way. Since they'll be in older commits, I'm going to delete them. It will be in previous commits, I'm going to delete it from the repo before this new commit. Should you gitignore them or go ahead and post them. Might confuse some people. I sure was last year.


Now I'm confused. After that bit of housekeeping, I ran `npm test` again.

## All Tests passed!
``` 47 passing (6s)

----------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
```

I'm not sure. But that means we are good to go.

# Start your server!
```$ nodemon
[nodemon] 1.11.0
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: *.*
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
(node:6264) DeprecationWarning: current URL string parser is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version. To use the new parser, pass option { useNewUrlParser: true } to MongoClient.connect.
Server listening on port 3005
Mongoose connected to mongodb://localhost/startpos
(node:6264) DeprecationWarning: collection.ensureIndex is deprecated. Use createIndexes instead.
```
Let's fix these Deprecation Warnings.
I'm not using MongoClient. Mongoose is. So Let's try to upgrade that.
- I have the latest version installed. Not sure about those warnings.

Nothing happened as a result of updating Mongoose.
```$ npm list mongodb-core
BenMerchant.dev-backend@0.3.0 Y:\bmdev-back
`-- mongoose@5.4.19
  +-- mongodb@3.1.13
  | `-- mongodb-core@3.1.11  deduped
  `-- mongodb-core@3.1.11
  ```
No idea how to get rid of warnings.

Mainly, the controllers and models need rearranged by feature or type, like the tests, not the way they are, by type of file or module.
Very similar to what people were saying about AngularJS. It's strange that EVERY SINGLE tutorial does it the "less good" way.
